HW 7

The log-log plots of relative errors are in "float-relerrors.png" and "double-relerrors.png". From the plots we can find that the error goes as: 
1/N^2 for the trapezoid rule (using double-relerrors.png, the slope = (-15+4)/(6.2-0.7) = -2), 
1/N^4 for the Simpson rule (using double-relerrors.png, the slope = (-30+8)/(6.2-0.7) = -4), 
1/N^6 for the Bode's rule (using double-relerrors.png, the slope = (-33+14.5)/(3.8-0.7) = -6).

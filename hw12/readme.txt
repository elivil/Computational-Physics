HW 12

I wrote the code in int10d.cc to calculate this integral using MC method. I obtain 25.8339 which gives a relative error of 0.0022% compared to
the true value of 155/6.

The code to study the error dependence on N is in mc10d.cc. The resulting plot is in error.png. As we can see, the error is proportional to 1/Sqrt(N).

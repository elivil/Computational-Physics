HW 16

A) Code is in rk4.cc. I plotted the results for p=2, p=4, p=7, p=10, p=11. On the plots I denote the function as x(t) instead of y(x). As can be seen
from the plots the result is periodic with constant amplitude and period.

B) Changing the initial conditions leads to different periods. See p7n.png for x(0)=2, xdot(0)=0.5 and compare with p7.png for x(0)=1, xdot(0)=0.

C and D) Code is in rk4t.cc. It records a number of periods and then averages them. Plots of period vs initial energy using the results of the code for
p=3 and p=7 are in TvsEp3.png and TvsEp7.png.

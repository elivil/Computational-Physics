HW3 Exponential series

a) Program that calculates summation for x=0.1,1,10,100 is in expsum.cc. The result is in expres.dat.

b) To investigate convergence, use code in expconv.cc. The result is in expconv.dat. As one can see, when x is small (<=10) the algorithm converges 
to the correct answer. When x is larger than 10, the algorithm converges to the wrong answer (the relative error from the built-in exp function is 
larger than the tolerance eps, as indicated by the flag 1 in the last column of expconv.dat). When x is too large, the algorithm does not even converge.

c) Codes for timing are in expgood.cc and expbad.cc. They simply calculate the sum for 9,990,000 numbers between 0.1 and 100 with step 0.00001. Timing
them gives 58.2s for expgood and 1m5.1s for expbad.

HW11

Program to generate random walks is in walk.cc. It takes as input an integer value for seeding the random generator. The results for different seeds
are plotted in walk1.png, walk2.png, walk3.png.

Program to study rms distance vs number of steps is in rwalk.cc. The plot in rms.png is generated from its output. Note that it takes some time to run
this program due to high number of steps (up to 90,000) in some walks.

Bad use of linear congruence method is in random.cc. Plot of the generated numbers is in badrand.png. Note the correlations between "random" numbers.
Built-in random generator is used in birand.cc. Plot of the generated numbers is in goodrand.png. Looks much better.

The plots of sqrt(N)*(1/N Sum(x_i)^k - 1/(k+1)) vs N are in testk1.png, testk3.png, testk7.png for k=1,3,7 respectively. The plots were made using 
data generated by randtest.cc.
